# The union of two sets returns a new set that contains all unique elements from both sets.
#  You can perform a union using the | operator or the .union() method.
# set1={1,2,3,4,4}
# set2={1,6,7,8,2}
# print(set1.union(set2))

# The intersection of two sets is a new set containing only the elements common to both sets. 
# You can use the & operator or the .intersection() method to perform an intersection.
# set1={1,2,3,4,4}
# set2={1,6,7,8,2}
# print(set1.intersection(set2))


# The difference between two sets is a new set containing elements that are in the first set but not in the second. 
# It subtracts one set from another. 
# You can perform a difference using the - operator or the .difference() method.
# set1={1,2,3,4,4}
# set2={1,6,7,8,2}
# print(set1.difference(set2))



# The symmetric difference between two sets is a new set containing all the elements that appear in either set but not both.
# You can perform a symmetric difference using the ^ operator or the .symmetric_difference() method.
# set1={1,2,3,4,4}
# set2={1,6,7,8,2}
# print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))
