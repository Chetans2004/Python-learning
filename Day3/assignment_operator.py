# Assignment Operators are used to assign values to variables.
# This operator is used to assign the value of the right side of the expression to the left side operand.


#1.Take a number and increase it by 10 using +=
# sum=int(input("Enter number"))
# sum+=10
# print(sum)
 
#2.Take a number and decrease it by 5 using

# sub=int(input("Enter number"))
# sub-=5
# print(sub)

#3.Take two numbers a and b. Add b to a using +=, then print both
# a=int(input("Enter first number"))
# b=int(input("Enter second number"))
# b+=a
# print(a,b)

#4.Write a program where you take an initial balance (say 1000) and 
# perform transactions using += (deposit) and -= (withdraw).
# initial_balance=1000
# deposit=int(input("Enter how much money you want to deposit"))
# deposit+=initial_balance
# withdraw=int(input("Enter how much money you want to withdraw"))
# initial_balance-=withdraw
# print("Intital balance = ",initial_balance ,"\n") 
# print("Balance After Deposit  = ",deposit ,"\n") 
# print("Balance After Withdraw = ",withdraw ,"\n")
