# #Comparison operators are used to compare two values. The result is always a Boolean value: True or False.
# #1.Compare two numbers a = 10 and b = 20 using:
# #==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# #Print all results.

# # a=10
# # b=20
# # print(a==b)
# # print(a>b)
# # print(a<b)
# # print(a!=b)
# #2.Check if a number is greater than or equal to 0
# num=100
# print(num>=0)
